This chapter should contain three things.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A copy of all the information on the title page of your master's thesis. This includes things like the name of your master's thesis and your advisors.
    \item A one-paragraph description of your master's thesis. This should be 15 to 20 lines long. This should include the context of your master's thesis, the problem statement of your master's thesis. The results of your master's thesis, and the evaluation of the work.
    \item Five keywords that describe the subject best.
\end{itemize}

The chapter should be one page at most.
